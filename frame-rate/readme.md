### Experiment 2: - Considering frame rate

It takes the browser several milliseconds to display visual stimuli.
This delay is caused mainly by the screen refresh rate.
We want to get an idea of how large this delay is, and see if we can reliably measure it from within the browser (ideally the player can report the exact times when stimuli are shown/hidden).
To test this we first measure how long it takes to display a stimulus after a keypress; this gives us a measure for the size of the display delay.
We then trigger another keypress; this signals the browser when the stimulus was actually displayed; this allows us to validate any browser generated estimation for the display time (keypress processing may be an issue by inflating the delay).

**Measurement 1** is generated by the Arduino.
It is a list of latencies from key press to stimulus presentation. We expect it to be at most 16ms (standard refresh rate).
**Measurement 2** is generated by the player.
It consists of the latency of the second keypress (in relation to the first), and any attempt to correct the measurement in relation to the actual display time.



How long does it take to actually present a stimulus?
How accurately does the player measure responses?


Player: Listen for PRESS:A then STIMULUS and listen for PRESS:B
Arduino: PRESS:A then listen for STIMULUS then PRESS:B

Measure:
Player measures latency from STIMULUS to PRESS:B
Arduino measures latency from PRESS:A to STIMULUS


We expect the latency of the Arduino to be composed of [input time + time to display] and the latency in the player to be composed of [time to display + input time] (hence, they should be more or less equal).


We should check if we can improve accuracy here by accurately measuring the presentation time of the stimulus (as opposed to the presentation command).
NOTE: functionally this experiment can be combined with experiment 2


The sequence of a single trail as I see it looks something like the following:
(use https://www.draw.io/ to create a diagram)
PRESS:A
Hardware input latency 
Player input latency
STIMULUS
Wait for animation frame
Display stimulus
PRESS:B
Hardware input latency 
Player input latency
End trial


Essentially we have
the player measuring from 1b/2 to 3b 
the arduino measuring from 1a to 2b/3


Both have one cycle of hardware latency, so hopefully that cancels out, and we can work directly on improving the display latency as measured by the arduino, and measurement accuracy as measured by the difference between the arduino measurement and the player measurement.


Oddly enough, the player measurement should equal to the arduino measurement + wait for animation frame.
