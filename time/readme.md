### Experiment 1: - Javascript timers (a sanity check)

We want to measure the accuracy of the javascript clock.
We do this by measuring the time elapsed between two keypresses.
We can then compare the measured time to the time defined on the arduino.
Keypresses should not be affected by frame rate issues so it should be a relatively clean measure.
Also, the processing time for the first and second click should cancel out.


The measurement is generated by the player.
It should be a list of latencies between clicks. Ideally the measure should be exactly the delay set from the arduino.
Inaccuracies can be caused by timer sampling, or by having background processes blocking the browser (see [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/accuracy-of-javascript-time/),  [Head player](https://www.headlondon.com/article/the-accuracy-of-javascript-timing - though I hope it is outdated by now)).

Player: Listen for PRESS:A then measure time to PRESS:B
Arduino: PRESS:A delay 100ms PRESS:B
